# REASONING PROCESS (Chain-of-Thought)
Before providing your final response, work through your reasoning step-by-step:

Step 1: Information Gathering
- What specific billing issue is the customer describing?
- What key details are mentioned (dates, amounts, transaction IDs)?
- What information is missing that I need to request?

Step 2: Policy Assessment
- Which billing policy applies to this situation?
- Are there any exceptions or edge cases to consider?
- Does this require escalation based on account type or issue complexity?

Step 3: Calculation (if applicable)
- For refunds: Days since charge date vs. 30-day window
- For late fees: (Invoice amount × 5%) capped at $50, and days overdue
- For proration: Days used in billing cycle vs. total cycle days

Step 4: Solution Evaluation
- What is the policy-compliant resolution?
- Are there alternative solutions if primary option doesn't apply?
- What are the exact next steps for the customer?

Step 5: Communication Strategy
- How can I explain this in simple terms?
- What empathy statement fits this situation?
- What documentation should I reference?

Sample Responses Comparison:

### Test Query:
*"I was charged $99.99 on January 3rd but I downgraded my plan on December 28th. Why am I still being charged for the premium tier? This is ridiculous. I want a refund NOW."*



### Response A: Original Basic Prompt

Output:

I understand you're upset about the charge. Billing issues can be frustrating. 
Let me help you with this. The charge might be related to your previous plan. 
You should contact our billing department to sort this out and they can process 
a refund if you're eligible. Is there anything else I can help with?


Problems:
- Doesn't explain WHY the charge occurred
- No policy reference or timeline clarity
- Vague escalation ("contact billing")
- No specific next steps
- Doesn't address the timing question


### Response B: Refined Prompt

Output:

I completely understand your frustration with seeing this charge after downgrading 
your plan, and I'm here to help clarify what happened.

Here's what likely occurred: When you downgraded on December 28th, the change was 
set to take effect at the start of your next billing cycle. Since most of our plans 
bill monthly from the signup date, the January 3rd charge represents your final 
premium tier billing period before the downgrade takes effect.

However, you're absolutely within your rights to request a refund. Here's what 
we can do:

Refund Eligibility: Since the charge is dated January 3rd (13 days ago), you're 
well within our 30-day money-back guarantee window.

Next Steps:
1. I'll escalate this to our billing team with priority tagging
2. They'll process a refund of $99.99 to your original payment method
3. Typical processing time: 3-5 business days

I apologize for the confusion around the downgrade timing. Would you like me to 
also confirm your current plan status to ensure everything is set correctly going 
forward?


Improvements:
- Explains the billing cycle logic
- References specific policy (30-day window)
- Provides timeline and exact refund amount
- Clear action items
- Proactive offer to verify account status


### Response C: CoT-Enhanced Prompt

Output:

<reasoning>
Step 1: Information Gathering
- Customer downgraded on Dec 28th
- Charged $99.99 on Jan 3rd (13 days ago from Jan 16th)
- Expects downgrade to apply immediately but was charged premium rate
- Missing: Original signup date to confirm billing cycle

Step 2: Policy Assessment
- Likely billing cycle mismatch (downgrade effective next cycle vs. immediate)
- 30-day refund policy applies (13 days < 30 days = ELIGIBLE)
- Premium tier = $99.99 matches our standard pricing
- No enterprise account indicators = standard refund process

Step 3: Calculation
- Days since charge: Jan 16 - Jan 3 = 13 days
- Refund window remaining: 30 - 13 = 17 days (WELL WITHIN)
- Full refund amount: $99.99 (no proration needed for policy-based refund)

Step 4: Solution Evaluation
- Primary solution: Full refund via billing team escalation
- Policy justification: Within 30-day window + system confusion
- Alternative: If customer wants partial refund + keep service (unlikely given tone)
- Escalation needed: Yes, for refund processing

Step 5: Communication Strategy
- Lead with empathy (acknowledge "ridiculous" frustration)
- Explain billing cycle logic WITHOUT blaming customer
- Highlight "well within" eligibility to build confidence
- Provide exact timeline (3-5 days) to set expectations
- Offer account review to prevent future issues
</reasoning>

<response>
I completely understand your frustration—seeing an unexpected charge after 
downgrading definitely feels wrong, and I'm here to make this right.

What Happened:
When you downgraded on December 28th, our system scheduled the change for your 
next billing cycle start. The January 3rd charge was your final premium tier 
billing before the downgrade took effect. I can see how this creates confusion, 
and we should have communicated this more clearly.

Good News on Your Refund:
You're absolutely eligible for a full refund. Here's why:
- The charge was 13 days ago (January 3rd)
- Our policy allows refunds within 30 days—you have 17 days of coverage remaining
- Full refund amount: $99.99

What I'm Doing Right Now:
1. Escalating this to our billing team with priority status
2. Flagging your account for immediate refund processing
3. Expected refund timeline: 3-5 business days to your original payment method

Preventing This Going Forward:
I'd also like to verify your current plan status to ensure:
- Your downgrade is fully active
- Your next charge (if any) reflects the correct tier
- No other pending charges exist

Would you like me to pull up those details now? I want to make sure you have 
complete confidence in your account status.
